# HTTP Listeners

The VerneMQ HTTP listener is used to serve various VerneMQ subsystems such as [Prometheus metrics](../monitoring/prometheus.md) and the [management API](../administration/http-administration.md) over HTTP. It is enabled by default and runs on port `8888`. To disable the HTTP listener or change the port, adapt the configuration in `vernemq.conf`:

```text
listener.http.default = 127.0.0.1:8888
```
