# Introduction

When working with a system like VerneMQ sometimes when troubleshooting it would
be nice to know what a client is actually sending and receiving and what VerneMQ
is doing with this information. For this purpose VerneMQ has a built-in tracing
mechanism which is safe to use in production settings as there is very little
overhead in running the tracer and has built-in protection mechanisms to stop
traces that produce too much information.

# Tracing clients

To trace a client the following command is available:

```text
vmq-admin trace client client-id=<client-id>
```

See the available flags by calling `vmq-admin trace client --help`.


A typical trace could look like the following:

```text
$ vmq-admin trace client client-id=client
No sessions found for client "client"
New session with PID <7616.3443.1> found for client "client"
<7616.3443.1> MQTT RECV: CID: "client" CONNECT(c: client, v: 4, u: username, p: password, cs: 1, ka: 30)
<7616.3443.1> Calling auth_on_register({{172,17,0,1},34274},{[],<<"client">>},username,password,true) 
<7616.3443.1> Hook returned "ok"
<7616.3443.1> MQTT SEND: CID: "client" CONNACK(sp: 0, rc: 0)
<7616.3443.1> MQTT RECV: CID: "client" SUBSCRIBE(m1) with topics:
    q:0, t: "topic"
<7616.3443.1> Calling auth_on_subscribe(username,{[],<<"client">>}) with topics:
    q:0, t: "topic"
<7616.3443.1> Hook returned "ok"
<7616.3443.1> MQTT SEND: CID: "client" SUBACK(m1, qt[0])
<7616.3443.1> Trace session for client stopped
```

In this particular trace a trace was started for the client with client-id
`client`. At first no clients are connected to the node where the trace has been
started, but a little later the client connects and we see the trace come
alive. The strange identifier `<7616.3443.1>` is called a process identifier and
is the identifier of the process in which the trace happened - this isn't
relevant unless one wants to correlate the trace with log entries where process
identifiers are also logged. Besides the process identifier there are some lines
with `MQTT SEND` and `MQTT RECV` which are to be understood from the perspective
of the broker. In the above trace this means that first the broker receives a
`CONNECT` frame and replies with a `CONNACK` frame. Each MQTT event is annotated
with the data from the MQTT frame to give as much detail and insight as
possible.

Notice the `auth_on_register` call between `CONNECT` and `CONNACK` which is the
authentication plugin hook being called to authenticate the client. In this case
the hook returned `ok` which means the client was successfully authenticated.

Likewise notice the `auth_on_subscribe` call between the `SUBSCRIBE` and
`SUBACK` frames which is plugin hook used to authorize if this particular
subscription should be allowed or not. In this case the subscription was
authorized.

{% hint style="info" %}
A convenient tool is the `ts` (timestamp) tool which is available on many
systems. If the trace output is piped to this command each line is prefixed with
a timestamp.
