# The VerneMQ health check

A simple way to gauge the health of a VerneMQ cluster is to query the `/health`
path on the [HTTP listener](../configuration/http-listeners.md).

The health check will return **200** when VerneMQ is accepting connections and
is joined with the cluster (for clustered setups). **503** will be returned in
case any of those two conditions are not met.
